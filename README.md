# Ajax Type Ahead
 
 ---
 
## The JavaScript30 Challenge is a free online course that helps developers improve their JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects, each focused on a specific aspect of the language. The Ajax Type Ahead project is one of the projects in this course, and it teaches developers how to create a search bar with dynamic suggestions based on the user's input.

In this project, use the Fetch API to retrieve data from a remote endpoint and use JavaScript to display that data in real-time as the user types in the search bar. The project also introduces regular expressions, which are used to match the user's input with the data retrieved from the endpoint.

Through a series of exercises and challenges, developers will learn how to parse JSON data, use regular expressions to filter and manipulate strings, and update the DOM in real-time with JavaScript. They'll also learn how to implement keyboard navigation for accessibility and how to handle errors that may occur during the data retrieval process.

Overall, the JavaScript30 Challenge Ajax Type Ahead project is a great way for developers to improve their skills with JavaScript, APIs, regular expressions, and real-time DOM manipulation. By completing this project, developers will gain valuable experience with techniques and technologies that are commonly used in modern web development.
